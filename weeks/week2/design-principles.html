                    Hick's Law basically states that the more stimuli a person has, the longer it 
                    will take for them to make a decision. Ideally websites have low amounts of 
                    stimulus so that the user can quickly make the desired desicion. This website tries
                    to sell a youtube to mp3 converter to the user, and it is uninteresting and white except
                    for the two colorful buttons they want the user to click!

                <p>
                    Fitt's law states that it takes longer for a user to reach a target 
                    (a button or something they want to mouse over or click on) the further away the
                    target is, and the smaller the target is. In this speedtest website, the button to activate
                    the test is quite large and in the middle of the screen, likely where the user's mouse or finger
                    would already be.

                <p>
                    If elements are cluttered together on a webpage, it can be hard for a user to discern elements
                    apart and the amount of information on screen at once can be overwhelming. Disney's website does a good job
                    of leaving plenty of space below the main title of the page, and plenty of room inbetween each picture that
                    represents a movie.
