        <h1 style="font-size: 2.2em;">Site Plan for the Virtual Garden</h1>
    <p style="color:grey; font-size: 0.8em;">I'm not making a Temple Inn and Sweets!</p>
    <p style="color:grey; font-size: 0.8em;">I'm not sure what exactly 'following design principles'
         means in the context of this assignment, but as this site plan isn't actually being used in the
          actual site so I'm just using inline styling for everything as it's faster. If thats a problem,
           tell me.</p>

    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The virtual garden is intended to be funny and relaxing. The user should be entertained by interacting
        with the site, and should leave more calm than they came. The site contains a few games for the user
        to burn time, as well as little parts of the site they can interact with to distract them from any
        worries they have.
    </p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The target audience are internet-savy people who are bored or stressed. This means that they will
        likely be rather young, and quite possibly attending school. The revenue stream for this site would
        be through advertisements, because, as it turns out, young people are the best to advertise to.
        The website is intended to gather visitors by word of mouth, as in people interact with the site 
        and enjoy it enough to tell their freinds about it.
    </p>

    <h2>Site Map</h2>
    The main page will link to three other pages: Games, Garden, and Antigarden. It will also contain controls that
    affect the user's experience on the other pages of the site. 
    <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Games</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Games page will have a few cute background elements to interact with, but mostly
        just contains links to rfk and plantclicker.</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 60px;">RFK</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 70px;">Contains the game robot finds kitten.</p>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 60px;">Plant Clicker</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 70px;">Clicking something and watching a number go up is surprisingly relaxing.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Garden</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The garden is the main selling point of the site, basically it will
    be an interactive area where the user can make little plants from predetermined pictures and drag and 
    drop them around.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">Antigarden</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        The Antigarden is meant to make fun of other websites by putting everything that people find annying about
        them in one spot. There will be a long, complex form that is difficult to use, clippy, and garish colors.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Scheme</h2>
    <p>The user will be able to alter how the colors on the site are displayed to them.</p>
        <p style="color: white; background-color:#004020; padding: 5px;">
            By default, the header and the footer as well as colored in sections of text will be white on dark green.
            (#004000)
        </p>

        <p>Other text on the site will be black on white.</p>

        <p style="background-color: #c8f8ff; padding: 5px;">
            Accents will be a light cyan. (#c8f8ff)</p>

        There will also be images of plants overlaying parts of the screen. These will be light green.

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <style>
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lobster&family=Lusitana&family=Niramit:wght@300&display=swap');
    </style>
    <p>A couple headings will use the lobster font (h1's). Others will use the Lusitana font.
         Text will use the Niramit font.</p>
         <h1 style="font-family: 'Lobster'; font-size: 2.2em;">Virtual Garden</h1>
         <h2 style="font-family: 'Lusitana';">Robot Finds Kitten</h2>
         <p style="font-family: 'Niramit';">Lorem ipsum dolor si emet, adisplicing sit elet</p>
