        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>The Virtual Garden is a place to relax, so why not play some games?
            Studies have found that playing video games reduces the risk of boredom by
            95%! If you are one of those 5% of people, then you can always head over to
            <a href="garden.html">the garden</a> and drag some plants around.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="rfk.html">Robot Finds Kitten</a></h3>
        <p>This is a game where everything is represented by characters, and you (the robot)
            try to find the character that represents kitten. The little characters have funny
            messages when you walk over them. This game is great because you can just read stuff
            and its not complicated or difficult.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="plantclicker.html">Plant Clicker</a></h3>
        <p>You click a plant and a number goes up. Very satisfying. I'm sure you've heard of other
            clicker games before, like tree clicker. Or beaver clicker!
