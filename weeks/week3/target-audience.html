        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <img src="images/warning.png" alt="A warning to the foolish">
        <p>A fair warning- This is really long because when I was making the content for this website, I looked up how to construct 
            personas, and landed on a website that established a super long and detailed process. I realise now that it was full of
            metaphorical feces, likley someone just writing a soulless 'buisinessy' article, but it fooled me regardless. I'm already
            too commited into these way-too-detailed personas to turn back now, however.</p>

        <p>
            The target audience of the site are buisiness owners who live in or near Hacker Valley. A secondary audience might be common people who live
    in or are researching hacker valley, and are interested in what the chamber is doing. Buisiness owners will likely be older, male, white,
    educated, and fond of activities such as golfing, fishing, hiking, and ranching, given the rural area (Hacker valley is in west virginia). They will likely own buisiness such
    as logging, agriculture/fishing, and ones found everywhere such as construction, carpentry, or a restauraunt owner.
